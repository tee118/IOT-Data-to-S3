# Realtime IOT Data Ingestion to S3

## Introduction
This project aims to create a system for realtime ingestion of IoT data to an S3 bucket. It involves the setup of AWS services like IoT Core, Firehose, Lambda, and S3 to enable seamless processing and storage of simulated solar power data.

## Architecture Overview
- **IoT Core:** Connects IoT devices and manages message transmission. Data from devices is sent to topics within IoT Core.
- **Amazon Firehose:** Acts as a delivery stream for real-time data. It automatically sends received data to Lambda functions for basic transformations before delivering it to the specified destination, such as an S3 bucket.
- **Lambda Functions:** Handle various tasks including simulating IoT data, transforming data received from Firehose, and sending data to IoT Core.

## Benefits
1. **Real-time Data Processing:** The system enables real-time processing of IoT data, allowing for immediate insights and actions based on the data stream.
2. **Scalability:** Leveraging AWS services ensures scalability, enabling the system to handle large volumes of data without compromising performance.
3. **Automation:** Automation of data processing tasks using Lambda functions reduces manual intervention and streamlines workflows.
4. **Data Integrity:** By storing data in an S3 bucket, the system ensures data integrity and durability, with built-in redundancy and backups.
5. **Flexibility:** The architecture allows for easy customization and integration with other AWS services or external systems as needed.

## Step-by-Step Setup
### Step 1: Bucket and IoT Core Setup
- Create an S3 bucket and an IoT topic for data transmission.
- Configure IoT Core to receive data from IoT devices and forward it to Firehose.

### Step 2: Lambda Function Setup
- Create Lambda functions for simulating IoT data and transforming data received from Firehose.
- Configure permissions for Lambda functions to interact with IoT Core and Firehose.

### Step 3: Firehose Configuration
- Create a Firehose delivery stream to receive data from IoT Core.
- Enable basic transformations and specify the Lambda function for data transformation.
- Set up stream parameters like buffer size, buffer intervals, and error handling.

### Step 4: IoT Core Integration
- Configure IoT Core to send data to the Firehose delivery stream.
- Define separators and create IAM roles for data transmission.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
- Test the setup by invoking the simulation Lambda function to send simulated IoT data.
- Monitor CloudWatch logs to ensure data processing and transmission are functioning correctly.
- Verify data storage in the S3 bucket and perform data analysis as needed.

## Usage
1. **Data Ingestion:** Simulate IoT data using the provided Lambda function and send it to the configured IoT Core topic.
2. **Data Transformation:** Firehose automatically applies basic transformations to the incoming data before delivering it to the S3 bucket.
3. **Data Storage:** Monitor the S3 bucket for stored data, which can be accessed for further analysis or processing.
4. **Data Analysis:** Use tools like AWS Glue, Athena, or Redshift to analyze the stored data and gain insights into solar power generation trends or anomalies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the setup of a robust data pipeline for processing and storing simulated solar power data in real-time. By leveraging AWS services like IoT Core, Firehose, Lambda, and S3, it enables efficient data ingestion, transformation, and storage, paving the way for further analysis and insights.
